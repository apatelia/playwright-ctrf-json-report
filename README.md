# Playwright JSON Reporter - CTRF

A Playwright test reporter to generate JSON test reports that are [CTRF](https://ctrf.io) compliant.

[Common Test Report Format](https://ctrf.io) helps you generate consistent JSON reports that are agnostic of specific programming languages or test frameworks.

## Features

- Generate JSON test reports that are [CTRF](https://ctrf.io) compliant
- Customizable output options, minimal or comprehensive reports
- Straightforward integration with Playwright
- Enhanced test insights with detailed test information, environment details, and more.

## What is CTRF?

A JSON test report schema that is the same structure, no matter which testing tool is used. It's created to provide consistent test reporting agnostic of specific programming languages or testing frameworks. Where many testing frameworks exist, each generating JSON reports in their own way, CTRF provides a standardised schema helping you generate the same report anywhere.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev playwright-ctrf-json-reporter
```

Add the reporter to your playwright.config.ts file:

```javascript
reporter: [
  ['list'], // You can combine multiple reporters
  ['playwright-ctrf-json-reporter', {}]
],
```

Run your tests:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

You'll find a JSON file named `ctrf-report.json` in the `ctrf` directory.

## Reporter Options

The reporter supports several configuration options:

```javascript
reporter: [
    ['playwright-ctrf-json-reporter', {
        outputFile: 'custom-name.json', // Optional: Output file name. Defaults to 'ctrf-report.json'.
        outputDir: 'custom-directory',  // Optional: Output directory path. Defaults to '.' (project root).
        minimal: true,                  // Optional: Generate a minimal report. Defaults to 'false'. Overrides screenshot and testType when set to true
        screenshot: false,              // Optional: Include screenshots in the report. Defaults to 'false'.
        testType: 'e2e',                // Optional: Specify the test type (e.g., 'api', 'e2e'). Defaults to 'e2e'.
        appName: 'MyApp',               // Optional: Specify the name of the application under test.
        appVersion: '1.0.0',            // Optional: Specify the version of the application under test.
        osPlatform: 'linux',            // Optional: Specify the OS platform.
        osRelease: '18.04',             // Optional: Specify the OS release version.
        osVersion: '5.4.0',             // Optional: Specify the OS version.
        buildName: 'MyApp Build',       // Optional: Specify the build name.
        buildNumber: '100',             // Optional: Specify the build number.
    }]
  ],
```

A comprehensive report is generated by default, with the exception of screenshots, which you must explicitly set to true.

## Test Object Properties

The test object in the report includes the following [CTRF properties](https://ctrf.io/docs/schema/test):

| Name         | Type             | Required | Details                                                                             |

## Advanced usage

Some features require additional setup or usage considerations.

### Screenshots

You can include base-64 screenshots in your test report, you'll need to capture and attach screenshots in your Playwright tests:

```javascript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'

test('basic test', async ({ page }, testInfo) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev')
  const screenshot = await page.screenshot({ quality: 50, type: 'jpeg' })
  await testInfo.attach('screenshot', {
    body: screenshot,
    contentType: 'image/jpeg',
  })
})
```

#### Supported Formats

Both JPEG and PNG formats are supported, only the last screenshot attached from each test will be included in the report.

#### Size Considerations

Base64-encoded image data can greatly increase the size of your report, it's recommended to use screenshots with a lower quality setting (less than 50%) to reduce file size, particularly if you are generating JPEG images.

### Browser

You can include browser information in your test report. You will need to extend Playwright's test object to capture and attach browser metadata for each test:

```javascript
// tests/helpers.ts
import { test as _test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import os from 'os';

export const test = _test.extend<{ _autoAttachMetadata: void }>({
    _autoAttachMetadata: [async ({ browser, browserName }, use, testInfo) => {
        // BEFORE: Generate an attachment for the test with the required info
        await testInfo.attach('metadata.json', {
            body: JSON.stringify({
                name: browserName,
                version: browser.version(),
            })
        })

        // ---------------------------------------------------------
        await use(/** our test doesn't need this fixture direcly */);
        // ---------------------------------------------------------

        // AFTER: There's nothing to cleanup in this fixutre
    }, { auto: true }],
})

export { expect };
```

Replace the standard Playwright test import with the custom test fixture in your test files:

```javascript
// tests/my-test.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from './helpers' // Adjust the path as necessary

test('example test', async ({ page }) => {
  // ... your test logic ...
})
```

The browser metadata file must be called metadata.json and contain properties name and version in the body.
